# Zap City

**Move with WASD or Arrow Keys.  Fire with Left Mouse Button.**

Assignment was to create a single level to showcase a Unique Gameplay Mechanic.  The player's chain/ball lightning attack uses OverlapCircles to tag enemies within range and loop through with a coroutine to simulate the delay between lightning chains.  Unity Events allow the lightning rods to talk to various other elements when they are charged or discharged.  Took 4 tilemaps but much easier than individual game objects.
